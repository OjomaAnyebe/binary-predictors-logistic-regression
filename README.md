# Binary Predictors in Logistic Regression - Exercise Solution

This repository contains the solution to the "Binary Predictors in a Logistic Regression - Exercise," part of my data science learning journey on Udemy.

## About the Exercise

This exercise focuses on applying logistic regression techniques to datasets containing binary predictors. It builds on foundational regression concepts, helping to solidify understanding of feature selection and model evaluation.

### Objectives

- Understand the role of binary predictors in logistic regression.
- Build and evaluate a logistic regression model using binary predictors.
- Interpret coefficients and assess model performance.
  
### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For dataset manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling.

### Key Steps in the Notebook

1. Import libraries and load the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on binary predictors.
3. Build a logistic regression model.
4. Evaluate the model using metrics such as:
   - Coefficients of binary predictors.
   - Model accuracy and performance metrics.
   - Visualizations for result interpretation.
5. Interpret the significance of binary predictors in the model.

## Learning Journey

This project is part of my hands-on exercises from Udemy's data science course. It demonstrates my progress in applying logistic regression techniques to real-world scenarios involving binary predictors.
